# markdown_math_escape

[Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) extension to escape math expressions like `$2\pi$`.

## Description

This extension just **protects** math expressions in your markdown document
from being processed as markdown expression.
The math expressions you wrote will be kept as they were,
so that they can be rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) or
[KaTeX](https://katex.org/) at client side (Web browsers).
